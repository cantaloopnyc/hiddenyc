            <p>Deep in Astoria lies the Steinway Piano Factory, where  over 1,500 grand pianos are made annually, each one composed of over 10,000 parts! </p>
            <p>The factory is a part of Steinway Village, a town built by the Steinway family, whose original intention was to house and accommodate the employees working at the piano factory. 
                Many of the original structures remain: firehouses, schools and churches.</p>
            <p>The factory, which is the only remaining piano factory in New York, has 300 employees, each specially trained to craft these pianos by hand, 
                still using tools and machines that were utilized by 19th-century workers! </p>
            <p>Visiting Steinway Piano Factory is possible with tours happening between the months of September-June on Tuesdays. 
                The tour allows you to observe the entire process of building an original Steinway piano from the raw wood to watching workers handmade keys. 
                Definitely an experience to partake in!</p>

            <p>One would think that with the many tall buildings in New York City, the only birds in the city are pigeons. 
                However, a trip to Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge quickly rebukes this notion!</p>  
            <p>Divided between the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, this is a birdwatcher's paradise still within city limits. 
                It's 9,000 acres of beautiful salt marshes, mudflats, ponds, woods and expansive open bay 
                where you can witness over 300 bird species migrating during various times of the year,
                as this is an important stop on the east coast for birds to rest their tired wings and feed.</p>
            <p>Take a walk along one of the many trails to see lush plants and additional wildlife,
                and definitely take advantage of the picnic areas and pack a lunch. 
                You can also simply sit and enjoy views of Rockaway Beach and, in the distance, the New York City skyline.</p>
