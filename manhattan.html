                <p>Roosevelt Island still remains much of an enigma to the average New Yorker. While technically considered part of Manhattan, Roosevelt Island was formally a place for insane asylums and prisons. With housing in New York a constant merry-go-round, today the island is packed with high-rise condos and luxury developments.</p> 
                <p>Located under the Queensboro Bridge in the East River, the ride on the brightly painted red aerial tram to get to and from the island is where the fun and the VIEWS begin! Using your metro card, you can take a cool glide over the Upper East Side and East River. It's a 360-degree picturesque view of Manhattan.</p> 
                <p>Once you land on the island, take the free bus that will drive you along the two-mile stretch of the island where you can essentially look back into the Upper East Side of Manhattan and take those Instagram-worthy pics!</p>

                <p>A waterfall in the middle of the city? Grab a lunch and head to Green Acre park, a tiny park on the Eastside in Midtown that has a really cool 25-foot waterfall surrounded by pretty foliage and plenty of seating. </p>
                <p>Behind the waterfall are of course the signature NYC skyscrapers, which offer an interesting view along with the fact that the sound from the waterfalls drown out the city noise; you literally feel like you aren't in New York at all.</p>
                <p>The waterfall has been around for close to 50 years, constructed in the '70s but looks and feels brand-new. Grab a book and relax in this city oasis.</p>

                <p>Head uptown to Washington Heights to take a nice breather from the city hustle, view stunning works of art while taking in a bit of nature along the way. The Cloisters at Fort Tryon Park, which is a part of The Metropolitan, is a favorite NYC secret for people that want to appreciate art and history without the crowds.</p>
                <p>Most of the collection is comprised of over 2,000 pieces of medieval art as well as architecture.</p>
                <p>The architecture of The Cloisters is delicate; a detailed, well-designed Gothic facade with a relaxing courthouse where one can sit and take in the beauty and the quiet.</p> 
                <p>Walk the grounds of this amazing museum while taking in views of the surrounding park and Hudson River.</p>
