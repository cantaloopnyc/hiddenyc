                <p>Brooklyn Heights Promenade, bordered by majestic townhouses and mansions in historic Brooklyn Heights is love overload.</p>
                
                <p>Hailed as one of the most romantic spots in the city, it offers impressive views of the Manhattan Skyline, Brooklyn Bridge and the Statue of Liberty. 
                A favorite destination for tourists, lovers, families, joggers and Brooklyn residents, the Promenade is a MUST no matter what time of day that you visit. 
                The promenade is a half mile long giving additional views of Governors Island, Ellis Island and Battery Park.</p>
                <p>Looking below, their are many newly designed facilities that you can walk down to and enjoy.
                The walk to the promenade is equally enjoyable as you literally get a front row view of some of the most impressive (and expensive) real estate in Brooklyn! 
                Streets are lined with brick brownstones covered in ivy; a great place to get away from the city while enjoying the view of the city! </p>

                <p>Although it has not been officially confirmed, many people say that the Brooklyn Art Library in Williamsburg
                has the world's largest collection of artist sketchbooks...an impressive collection of over 30,000 sketchbooks from artists all over the world.</p>
                <p>This is the officially library of 'The Sketchbook Project', an ambitious and successful venture of collecting the 'doodles' of artists since 2006. 
                Sketchbooks are given a barcode allowing the borrower to categorize and search artists by medium and region! </p>
                <p>The most amazing thing is that sketchbooks are allowed to be checked out for FREE as long as you have a library card.</p> 
                <p>If you are not in Brooklyn, many sketches can be found online the Brooklyn Art Library website.
                Visitors love the remote location and quiet atmosphere as well as the ability to find unique artists works from around the globe.</p>
