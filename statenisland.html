            <p>Are you sure this is still New York? Many visitors of Staten Island's High Rock Park often take away the feeling of being upstate once they visit this landmark, as you can 
                immediately forget that you are technically still in New York City.</p> 
            <p>The six walking trails, various lush wetlands and five pools are a welcome getaway from the hustle and 
                bustle of daily urban life.</p> 
            <p>In addition, there are deep woods with an array of vegetation as well as many animals; ducks, herons, owls, hawks, turtles, frogs, woodpeckers 
                and muskrats call High Rock park their home. </p>
            <p>Many visitors also enjoy climbing Mt. Moses, a 260-foot hill where the view is definitely worth the climb.</p>

            <p>This historic town will quickly make you forget that you live in one of the most modern cities in the world. The city of New York and the Staten Island Historical Society 
                collaborated to carefully restore and conserve to ensure that the original structures of many of the buildings remain intact - therefore, visitors are looking at original 
                architecture built centuries ago.</p> 
            <p>There is definitely a nostalgic feeling viewing over 100 acres of preserved homes and commercial buildings. Although some of the buildings 
                are closed, visitors can still tour the grounds with or without a guide.</p> <p>Don't forget to stop over at Decker Farm, New York City's oldest farm which is still in operation...
                and amazingly still in its ORIGINAL location after three centuries.</p>
