            Welcome to Wave Hill, a beautiful garden and cultural hub in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. </p>
            <p>Gardens and landscapes decorate this beautiful 28 acre of land which has breathtaking views overlooking the Hudson River and Palisades.
            It's a nature wonderland with detailed and almost perfectly manicured gardens, sweet waterlily and lotus-laced pools, along with many benches and outdoor seating
            just to simply stop and take it all in. </p>
            <p>Wave Hill was once a private estate from the 19th century; home to historical figures such as former president Theodore Roosevelt and writer Mark Twain. </p>
            <p>Along with the gardens are two properties, Wave Hill House and Glyndor House, where you can enjoy a multitude of programming from concerts, art exhibitions and the occasional wedding if you wanna crash! 
            Free shuttles run daily from W. 242th St stop on the #1 train.</p>

                Little Italy in the Bronx? Absolutely! While most visitors and even New York natives are all-too familiar with the Little Italy wedged in between Chinatown, many are surprised that in a section of the Bronx called Belmont, 
                many residents will proudly tell you that "THIS is the REAL Little Italy."</p>
                <p>Arthur Avenue is hard to miss; you know you are in Little Italy from the scent of fresh bread and canolis
                from one of the many neighborhood bakeries, or just look around and see Italian flags as well as red, white and green garland EVERYWHERE.</p>
                <p>Along with bakeries are cigar factories, fresh seafood, homemade pasta and many delicious cured meat stores; the food is AUTHENTIC (this ain't the Olive Garden) 
                and the people are more than welcoming, giving anyone with a listening ear the history of Little Italy.</p>
                <p>If you don't have a lot of time to visit, although a full day is recommended, stop at the Arthur Avenue Retail Market
                and please don't leave without tasting an array of goodies like fresh balsamic vinegar, imported olives and a salami-packed hero.</p>
